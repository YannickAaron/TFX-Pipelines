	abstract = {The demand for e-hailing services is growing rapidly, especially in large cities. Uber is the first and most popular e-hailing company in the United States and New York City (NYC). A comparison of the demand for yellow cabs and Uber in NYC in 2014 and 2015 shows that the demand for Uber has increased. However, this demand may not be distributed uniformly either spatially or temporally. Using spatiotemporal models can help us to better understand the demand for e-hailing services and to predict it more accurately. This paper proposes a new approach for analyzing and predicting the Uber demand. Moreover, the prediction performances of several statistical models are compared including one temporal model [vector autoregressive (VAR)] and two proposed spatiotemporal models [spatial-temporal autoregressive (STAR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator applied on STAR (LASSO-STAR)], for different scenarios (based on the number of time and space lags), and for both rush hour and non-rush hour periods. The results show the need of considering spatial models for taxi demand and demonstrate significant improvement in the prediction of demand using the two proposed models.

However, predicting passenger demand over multiple time horizons is generally challenging due to the nonlinear and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. In this work, we propose to model multistep citywide passenger demand prediction based on a graph and use a hierarchical graph convolutional structure to capture both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Our model consists of three parts: 1) a long-term encoder to encode historical passenger demands; 2) a shortterm encoder to derive the next-step prediction for generating multi-step prediction; 3) an attentionbased output module to model the dynamic temporal and channel-wise information. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our model consistently outperforms many baseline methods and state-of-the-art models.},

This trend has led to the development of distributed storage frameworks that incrementally scale out by assimilating resources as necessary. While challenging in its own right, storing and managing voluminous datasets is only the precursor to a broader ﬁeld of research: extracting insights, relationships, and models from the underlying datasets. The focus of this study is twofold: exploratory and predictive analytics over voluminous, multidimensional datasets in a distributed environment. Both of these types of analysis represent a higher-level abstraction over standard query semantics; rather than indexing every discrete value for subsequent retrieval, our framework autonomously learns the relationships and interactions between dimensions in the dataset and makes the information readily available to users. This functionality includes statistical synopses, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, probabilistic structures, and predictive models that not only enable the discovery of nuanced relationships between dimensions, but also allow future events and trends to be predicted. The algorithms presented in this work were evaluated empirically on a real-world geospatial time-series dataset in a production environment, and are broadly applicable across other storage frameworks.},

	abstract = {The output of a deep-learning model delivers different predictions depending on the input of the deep learning model. In particular, the input characteristics might affect the output of a deep learning model. When predicting data that are measured with sensors in multiple locations, it is necessary to train a deep learning model with spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Additionally, since not all of the data measured together result in increasing the accuracy of the deep learning model, we need to utilize the correlation characteristics between the data features. However, it is difﬁcult to interpret the deep learning output, depending on the input characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze how the input characteristics affect prediction results to interpret deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a visualization system to analyze deep learning models with air pollution data. The proposed system visualizes the predictions according to the input characteristics. The input characteristics include space-time and data features, and we apply temporal prediction networks, including gated recurrent units (GRU), long short term memory (LSTM), and spatiotemporal prediction networks (convolutional LSTM) as deep learning models. We interpret the output according to the characteristics of input to show the effectiveness of the system.},

For the sake of tackling the imbalance between supply and demand, taxi demand forecasting can help drivers plan their routes and reduce waiting time and oil pollution. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for taxi demand forecasting with multi-source data using Generative Adversarial Networks. Firstly, main features were extracted from multi-source data, including GPS taxi data, road network data, weather data, and points of interest. Secondly, Generative Adversarial Network, comprised of the recurrent network model and the conventional network model, is adopted for ﬁne-grained taxi demand forecasting. A comprehensive experiment is conducted based on a real-world dataset of the city of Wuhan, China. The experimental results showed that our model outperforms state-of-the-art prediction methods and validates the usefulness of our model. This paper provides insights into the temporal, spatial, and external factors in taxi demand-supply equilibrium based on the results. The ﬁndings can help policymakers alter the taxi supply and the taxi lease rents for periods and increase taxi proﬁt.},

It also reduces the waiting time of passengers and cruising time of taxi drivers. Even, there are some works proposed to predict the demand of taxi but there are few studies that consider the function of areas such as hospital area, department store area, residential area, and tourist attraction. One predictive model may not fit with all types of area. We use a point of interest (POI) to match taxi demand with a place to study the taxi demand in the area with a different function. In this paper, we investigate the best predictive models that can forecast demand of taxi hourly with 7 types of area function. The models that were selected for the experiment are long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST). Then, we proposed the ensemble model that can forecast the taxi demand well with all types of area function using the information from those machine learning models. We build the models based on a real-world dataset generated by over 5,000 taxis in Bangkok, Thailand for 4 months. The result shows that the proposed ensemble model can outperform other models in overall.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of passenger demands for taxis is vital for reducing the waiting time of passengers and drivers in large cities as we move towards smart transportation systems. However, existing works are limited in fully utilizing multi-modal features. First, these models either include excessive data from weakly correlated regions or neglect the correlations with similar but spatially distant regions. Second, they incorporate the inﬂuence of external factors (e.g., weather, holidays) in a simplistic manner by directly mapping external features to demands through fully-connected layers and thus result in substantial bias as the inﬂuence of external factors is not uniﬁed. To tackle these problems, we propose an end-to-end multi-task deep learning model for passenger demand prediction. First, we select similar regions for each target region based on their Point-of-Interest (PoI) information or historical demand and utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract their spatial correlations. Second, we map external factors to future demand levels as part of the multi-task learning framework to further boost prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset collected from a city in China with a population of 1.5 million. The results demonstrate that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the stateof-the-art and a set of baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs), which emulate the parallel distributed processing of the human nervous system, have proven to be very successful in dealing with complicated problems, such as function approximation and pattern recognition. Due to their powerful capability and functionality, ANNs provide an alternative approach for many engineering problems that are difﬁcult to solve by conventional approaches. Rainfall forecasting has been a difﬁcult subject in hydrology due to the complexity of the physical processes involved and the variability of rainfall in space and time. In this study, ANNs were adopted to forecast short-term rainfall for an urban catchment. The ANNs were trained to recognise historical rainfall patterns as recorded from a number of gauges in the study catchment for reproduction of relevant patterns for new rainstorm events. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of temporal and spatial information on short-term rainfall forecasting. To achieve this aim, a comparison test on the forecast accuracy was made among the ANNs conﬁgured with different orders of lag and different numbers of spatial inputs. In developing the ANNs with alternative conﬁgurations, the ANNs were trained to an optimal level to achieve good generalisation of data. It was found in this study that the ANNs provided the most accurate predictions when an optimum number of spatial inputs was included into the network, and that the network with lower lag consistently produced better performance. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Taxi demand prediction has recently attracted increasing research interest due to its huge potential application in large-scale intelligent transportation systems. However, most of the previous methods only considered the taxi demand prediction in origin regions, but neglected the modeling of the speciﬁc situation of the destination passengers. We believe it is suboptimal to preallocate the taxi into each region-based solely on the taxi origin demand. In this paper, we present a challenging and worthexploring task, called taxi origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand between all-region pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges come from how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the demand patterns. We address this problem with a novel contextualized spatial–temporal network (CSTN), which consists of three components for the modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC), and global correlation context (GCC), respectively. First, an LSC module utilizes two convolution neural networks to learn the local spatial dependencies of taxi, demand respectively, from the origin view and the destination view. Second, a TEC module incorporates the local spatial features of taxi demand and the meteorological information to a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Network (ConvLSTM) for the analysis of taxi demand evolution. Finally, a GCC module is applied to model the correlation between all regions by computing a global correlation feature as a weighted sum of all regional features, with the weights being calculated as the similarity between the corresponding region pairs. The extensive experiments and evaluations on a largescale dataset well demonstrate the superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods for the taxi origin-destination demand prediction.},

It presents the most important approaches to the analysis of time series, which may be stationary or nonstationary. Modelling and forecasting univariate time series is the starting point. For multiple stationary time series, Granger causality tests and vector autogressive models are presented. As the modelling of nonstationary uni- or multivariate time series is most important for real applied work, unit root and cointegration analysis as well as vector error correction models are a central topic. Tools for analysing nonstationary data are then transferred to the panel framework. Modelling the (multivariate) volatility of financial time series with autogressive conditional heteroskedastic models is also treated.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed ?Volunteered Geographical Information? (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

The data set includes monthly trade balance intervals from January 2000 to June 2019. The contribution investigates and subsequently smooths two time series: the CR import from the PRC; the CR export to the PRC. The balance of trade of both countries in the entire monitored period is negative from the perspective of the CR. A total of 10,000 neural networks are generated. 5 neural structures with the best characteristics are retained. Neural networks are able to capture both the trend of the entire time series and its seasonal fluctuations, but it is necessary to work with time series lag. The CR import from the PRC is growing and it is expected to grow in the future. The CR export to the PRC is growing and it is expected to grow in the future, but its increase in absolute values will be slower than the increase of the CR import from the PRC.},

	abstract = {One sector that severely suffers from the outbreak of the coronavirus is carsharing (i.e., short-term car access). The downswing of the carsharing industry may not only experience negative economic consequences but also ecological ones. Carsharing has the potential to reduce emissions, occupied space, and congestion and hence can actively contribute to mitigating climate change. As Bill Gates strikingly states: “Covid-19 is awful. Climate change could be worse.” For this reason, it is important to understand which underlying mechanisms drive carsharing usage during the Covid-19 pandemic. The current research has the overall objective to provide deeper insights into the mediating mechanisms that explain carsharing usage intention during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we draw on signaling theory to explore how different claims (environmental claims, safety claims) that prompt two different opposing underlying processes (perceived ecological benefits, perceived physical risk) influence carsharing usage intention. An online experiment employing a 3 (environmental claim vs. safety claim vs. no claim) × 2 (high information diagnosticity vs. low information diagnosticity) between-subjects design with participants acquired by the online panel platform Clickworker was conducted in April 2020. Fictitious labels and fictitious advertisements served as stimulus material and constituted the five experimental conditions. The data were analyzed by a multicategorial moderated mediation analysis and a multivariate analysis of covariance. Results reveal that environmental claims can stimulate perceived ecological benefits, which, in turn, positively affect carsharing usage intention. Interestingly, our research demonstrates that safety claims cannot decrease perceived physical risk in the context of Covid-19 and carsharing. Nevertheless, perceived physical risk has a (marginal) negative influence on carsharing usage intention and hence should not be discarded altogether. The findings of this article offer new insights into the mental processes that guide consumer decision-making during the coronavirus crisis and also offer important policy implications by highlighting the relevance of environmental claims during the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the negative influence of perceived physical risk on carsharing usage intention points to the need for alternative measures to reduce users' risk perceptions.},

	abstract = {Public transport use has drastically declined during the COVID-19 pandemic because the virus spreads through close contact with infected people and contaminated surfaces, especially in closed-environments. Evidence suggests that following the necessary safety guidelines can limit the spread of the virus, however, non-compliance to precautionary measures has been reported widely. Ignoring the precautionary measures may lead to quick transmission of the virus since public transport vehicles generally resemble closed-environments. This study explores people’s intentions to use public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic while adhering to precautionary measures. For this purpose, a total of 1516 useable responses were collected through a questionnaire survey conducted in Lahore, Pakistan. Regression models were developed to model the intentions to use public transport during the pandemic, to adhere to the precautionary measures while using public transport during the pandemic, and to use public transport while suffering from COVID-19 disease. The results of this study will help in understanding the intentions of the public transport users during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also provide insights for policymakers and public transport operators about further necessary actions to promote safe public transport use during the current and any possible future pandemics. As public transport use declined during the pandemic, policy implications for alternative mobility options such as demand-responsive-transport (DRT) are also presented. Considering the study results, a policy interventions framework is proposed to promote the safe use of various public transport modes, particularly in developing regions.},

	abstract = {Recently a variety of methods have been developed to encode graphs into low-dimensional vectors that can be easily exploited by machine learning algorithms. The majority of these methods start by embedding the graph nodes into a low-dimensional vector space, followed by using some scheme to aggregate the node embeddings. In this work, we develop a new approach to learn graph-level representations, which includes a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning components. We start by learning a set of node representations in an unsupervised fashion. Graph nodes are mapped into node sequences sampled from random walk approaches approximated by the Gumbel-Softmax distribution. Recurrent neural network (RNN) units are modified to accommodate both the node representations as well as their neighborhood information. Experiments on standard graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior or comparable performance relative to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed and classification accuracy. We further illustrate the effectiveness of the different components used by our approach.},

Foreword CRISP-DM was conceived in late 1996 by three \&quot; veterans \&quot; of the young and immature data mining market. DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz) was already experienced, ahead of most industrial and commercial organizations, in applying data mining in its business operations. SPSS (then ISL) had been providing services based on data mining since 1990 and had launched the first commercial data mining workbench – Clementine – in 1994. NCR, as part of its aim to deliver added value to its Teradata data warehouse customers, had established teams of data mining consultants and technology specialists to service its clients\&\#39; requirements. At that time, early market interest in data mining was showing signs of exploding into widespread uptake. This was both exciting and terrifying. All of us had developed our approaches to data mining as we went along. Were we doing it right? Was every new adopter of data mining going to have to learn, as we had initially, by trial and error? And from a supplier\&\#39;s perspective, how could we demonstrate to prospective customers that data mining was sufficiently mature to be adopted as a key part of their business processes? A standard process model, we reasoned, non-proprietary and freely available, would address these issues for us and for all practitioners. A year later we had formed a consortium, invented an acronym (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), obtained funding from the European Commission and begun to set out our initial ideas. As CRISP-DM was intended to be industry-, tool-and application-neutral, we knew we had to get input from as wide a range as possible of practitioners and others (such as data warehouse vendors and management consultancies) with a vested interest in data mining. We did this by creating the CRISP-DM Special Interest Group (\&quot; The SIG \&quot; , as it became known). We launched the SIG by broadcasting an invitation to interested parties to join us in Amsterdam for a day-long …},

The main issue is how to choose the weight \$λ\$ balancing those two terms. In practice, this parameter is selected by assessing a list of candidates (e.g. cross validation), which is inappropriate for the real time application. In this work, we revisit 1D Total Variation restoration algorithm proposed by Tibshirani and Taylor. A heuristic method is integrated for estimating a good choice of \$λ\$ based on the extremums number of restored signal. We propose an offline version of restoration algorithm in O(n log n) as well as its online implementation in O(n). Combining the rapid algorithm and the automatic choice of \$λ\$, we propose a real-time automatic denoising algorithm, providing a large application fields. The simulations show that our proposition of \$λ\$ has a similar performance as the states of the art.},

However, many organizations prefer to transfer data from an operational NoSQL database to a SQL-based relational database for using existing tools for business intelligence, analytics, decision making, and reporting. The existing methods of NoSQL to relational database transformation require manual schema mapping, which requires domain expertise and consumes noticeable time. Therefore, an efficient and automatic method is needed to transform an unstructured NoSQL database into a structured database. In this paper, we proposed and evaluated an efficient method to transform a NoSQL database into a relational database automatically. In our experimental evaluation, we used MongoDB as a NoSQL database, and MySQL and PostgreSQL as relational databases to perform transformation tasks for different dataset sizes. We observed excellent performance, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, in transforming data from a NoSQL database into a relational database.},

These vehicles typically pick-up and drop-off passengers in locations according to passengers needs and can include taxis, buses or other vehicles.One of the most widespread types of demand-responsive transport (DRT) is to provide a public transport service in areas of low passenger demand where a regular bus service is not considered to be financially viable, such as rural and peri-urban areas. Services may also be provided for particular types of passengers. One example is the paratransit programs for people with a disability. The provision of public transport in this manner emphasises one of its functions as a social service rather than creating a viable movement network.},

Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research.},

	abstract = {Region-level demand forecasting is an essential task in ridehailing services. Accurate ride-hailing demand forecasting can guide vehicle dispatching, improve vehicle utilization, reduce the wait-time, and mitigate traffic congestion. This task is challenging due to the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies among regions. Existing approaches mainly focus on modeling the Euclidean correlations among spatially adjacent regions while we observe that non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among possibly distant regions are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (ST-MGCN), a novel deep learning model for ride-hailing demand forecasting. We first encode the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among regions into multiple graphs and then explicitly model these correlations using multi-graph convolution. To utilize the global contextual information in modeling the temporal correlation, we further propose contextual gated recurrent neural network which augments recurrent neural network with a contextual-aware gating mechanism to re-weights different historical observations. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale ride-hailing demand datasets and observe consistent improvement of more than 10\% over stateof-the-art baselines.},

Accurate traffic prediction can assist route planing, guide vehicle dispatching, and mitigate traffic congestion. This problem is challenging due to the complicated and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies between different regions in the road network. Recently, a significant amount of research efforts have been devoted to this area, especially deep learning method, greatly advancing traffic prediction abilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on deep learning-based approaches in traffic prediction from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we first summarize the existing traffic prediction methods, and give a taxonomy. Second, we list the state-of-the-art approaches in different traffic prediction applications. Third, we comprehensively collect and organize widely used public datasets in the existing literature to facilitate other researchers. Furthermore, we give an evaluation and analysis by conducting extensive experiments to compare the performance of different methods on a real-world public dataset.

The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12\% - 15\% over state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Modeling multivariate time series has long been a subject that has attracted researchers from a diverse range of fields including economics, finance, and traffic. A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets and achieves on-par performance with other approaches on two traffic datasets which provide extra structural information.},

	abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting problems often contain a complex mix of inputs -- including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed historically -- without any prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

              Worldwide scientific output is growing faster and faster. Academics should not only publish much and fast, but also publish research with impact. The aim of this study is to use machine learning to investigate characteristics of articles that were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology between 2009 and 2018, and characterize high-impact articles. Article impact was assessed for 4,531 publications by three common impact metrics: the Altmetric Attention Scores, downloads, and citations. Additionally, a broad collection of (more than 200) characteristics was collected from the article’s title, abstract, authors, keywords, publication, and article engagement. We constructed random forest (RF) regression models to predict article impact and articles with the highest impact (top-25\% and top-10\% for each impact metric), which were compared with a naive baseline method. RF models outperformed the baseline models when predicting the impact of unseen articles ( P {\textless} 0.001 for each impact metric). Also, RF models predicted top-25\% and top-10\% high-impact articles with a high accuracy. Moreover, RF models revealed important article characteristics. Higher impact was observed for articles about exercise, training, performance and V̇o

              , reviews, human studies, articles from large collaborations, longer articles with many references and high engagement by scientists, practitioners and public or via news outlets and videos. Lower impact was shown for articles about respiratory physiology or sleep apnea, editorials, animal studies, and titles with a question mark or a reference to places or individuals. In summary, research impact can be predicted and better understood using a combination of article characteristics and machine learning.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {Large quantities of spatiotemporal (ST) data can be easily collected from various domains such as transportation, social media analysis, crime analysis, and human mobility analysis. The development of ST data analysis methods can uncover potentially interesting and useful information. Due to the complexity of ST data and the diversity of objectives, a number of ST analysis methods exist, including but not limited to clustering, prediction, and change detection. As one of the most important methods, clustering has been widely used in many applications. It is a process of grouping data with similar spatial attributes, temporal attributes, or both, from which many significant events and regular phenomena can be discovered. In this paper, some representative ST clustering methods are reviewed, most of which are extended from spatial clustering. These methods are broadly divided into hypothesis testing-based methods and partitional clustering methods that have been applied differently in previous research. Research trends and the challenges of ST clustering are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08714},
	abstract = {Taxi demand prediction is an important building block to enabling intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However, existing methods on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (e.g., using CNN) or temporal relation (e.g., using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.},
